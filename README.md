# Polybar config

This repo contains my configuration files for [Polybar](https://github.com/polybar/polybar), which I use as the statusbar for my [Awesome WM](https://github.com/Quantiux/awesome). Custom module scripts are located in the `scripts` folder. Some of these scripts are hardware-specific, and will require suitable modifications on a different machine.
